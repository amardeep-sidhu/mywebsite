The last one I wrote was on Mar 3, 2009 for &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Collaborations 2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am not really the one who was eagerly waiting for this album but actually this post is a mix of two posts; ie music review of this album and some in general stuff that I have been thinking about Gurdas Maan’s performance in the last few years. I am sorry if this post sounds like a too critical one. So lets get going with the music review first.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
