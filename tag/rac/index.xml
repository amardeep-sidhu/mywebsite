&lt;p>Faced this issue recently at one of the customer sites where performance in one of the databases went down suddenly. It was a 2 node RAC on 12.1.0.2 running on Linux 7 using some kind of Hitachi SSD storage array. There were no changes as per DBA, application, OS and storage teams. But something must have changed somewhere. Otherwise why would performance degrade just like that. I &amp;amp; my colleague checked some details and found that something happened in the morning a day before. Starting from that point in time, the execution time for all the commonly run queries shot up. Generally speaking, when all the queries are doing bad and you are sure that nothing has been changed on the database side, the reasons could be outside the database. But being a DBA, it is not easy to prove that. We took AWRs from good and bad times and the wait events section looked like this:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Database performance degradation due to multipath issues gatsby</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog3/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues-gatsby/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:54:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog3/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues-gatsby/</guid><description>&lt;p>To put it in bit of an Indian context, database is not your daughter-in-law that you can blame it for every performance issue that occurs in the environment.

&lt;p>Workaround is to pass the -T option to scp to ignore the new checks. You can rename the scp binary to something like scp.original and create a new shell script there like this:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
